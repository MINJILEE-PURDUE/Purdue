1. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence): only one thing can do. e.g. self driving, web searching...
2. ANL (Artificial Narrow Intelligence): can do anything like human can do

Machine Learning is a method to establish successful AI. It is divided into two parts: Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning


### Supervised Learning
- classification
- regression

### Unsupervised Learning
- clustering
