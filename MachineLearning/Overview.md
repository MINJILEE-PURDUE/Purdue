### Artificial Intelligence

1. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence): only one thing can do. e.g. self driving, web searching...
2. ANL (Artificial Narrow Intelligence): can do anything like human can do

- ML is a computer program is said to be learn from experiece E with respect to some class of task T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. *Tom Mitchell, 1997*
- ML is a method to establish successful AI.

#### Benefits of ML
- Solutions requires a lot of manual tuning or long lists of rules: ML can make the code easier and performs better
- Complex problems with no good solutions with the traditional approach
- Dynamic environments: be able to adapt to new data
- Getting insides about complex problems and large amount of data

It is divided into several types: Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning based on "labeled". + Reinforcement learning


#### Supervised Learning
- classification
- regression

#### Unsupervised Learning
- clustering
