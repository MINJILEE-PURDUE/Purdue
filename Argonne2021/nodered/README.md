The goal of this project aims to integrate Node-RED into the existing SAGE cloud computing platform and web portal. This file provides descriptions and several tutorials for Node-Red so that users can understand how Node-RED works on the Sage system. All code flows related to SDR querying are also available in this folder.

Sage Data for NodeRED, the node can be configured with a standard query filter. For more general information about data queries, see the [docs](https://docs.sagecontinuum.org/docs/tutorials/accessing-data).
